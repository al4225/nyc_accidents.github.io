### Introduction

Increasing car accidents has been a serious issue in New York City, which may cause serious threats to personal and property security. To reduce the number of car accidents, we will utilize the NYC car accident dataset in 2020 to analyze the factors contributing to accidents. Through data analysis, we will obtain the peak time period, concentrated areas, and main causes of accidents, aiming to effectively decrease the rate of car accidents taking place and further ensure personal safety.
